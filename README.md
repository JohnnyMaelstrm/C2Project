# C2Project ( Not completed project yet, still working with this one !! )
This is my personal project on setting up a fully functional C2 environment using virtual machines. It explores command & control (C2) techniques, focusing on red team tactics for simulating cyberattacks.

The main goal of this project is to simulate real-world scenarios where a malicious actor attempts to gain access, move through target systems, and maintain persistence within a network.
In this project, the Havoc framework was used to build and deploy the C2 infrastructure. 










I want to thank all those involved for enabling this project!
